# Documentation Guidelines

## 1. Governance
- All major architectural decisions must be recorded in `docs/roadmaps/`.
- The `README.md` must be the single source of truth for "Getting Started".

## 2. Format
- Use Markdown (`.md`).
- Keep lines under 100 characters where possible.
- Use Mermaid diagrams for complex logic.

## 3. Maintenance
- Update `walkthrough.md` after every major release.
- Ensure `DEPLOY.md` is synced with `package.json` scripts.
