## 🎯 The Mission: "The Kingston 150"

Scraping 60,000 messy records helps no one. **Kingston Care Connect** takes a different approach: **Manual Curation over Automatic Extraction.**

We maintain a strict, hand-verified dataset of the **Top 150 High-Impact Services** for Kingston residents, ensuring that every result is:

1.  **Verified** (No broken links or dead numbers).
2.  **Accessible** (Clear eligibility criteria).
3.  **Identity-Aware** (Evidence-backed safety tags).

## 🚀 New Features (v4.1)

- **Advanced Search Intelligence**:
  - **Synonym Expansion**: Searches for "hungry" find food banks; "rent" finds eviction prevention.
  - **"Open Now" Filter**: Real-time filtering based on structured operating hours.
  - **Privacy-First Analytics**: Anonymously tracks unmet needs (Zero-Result patterns) without logging queries.
  - **Crisis Detection**: Instant boosting of emergency services for high-risk queries.
- **Bilingual Ready**: Full support for English and French content switching.
- **Global Deployment**: Specialized Crisis Mode instantly boosts emergency services.

-   **🧠 Semantic & Fuzzy Search:** Multi-layered search experience. Type natural language like "I feel unsafe" (Semantic) or fix typos like "fod" (Fuzzy).
-   **🔒 Privacy-First:** No cookies, no tracking, and no search logs. All inference happens in your browser or anonymously.
-   **📄 Internal Detail Pages:** High-resolution public service pages with rich metadata, contact info, and localized content.
-   **💼 Partner Claiming:** Built-in workflow for local organizations to claim, verify, and maintain their listings.
-   **📱 Installable App (PWA):** Works offline and can be installed on your home screen.
-   **🗣️ Community Governance:** Built-in feedback loops allow residents to flag incorrect data instantly.
-   **⚡ Zero-Latency:** Optimized for instant loads even on poor data connections.
