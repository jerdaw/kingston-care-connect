## The Kingston 150

Large-scale scraping of municipal data produces noise, not value. Kingston Care Connect takes a different path: **manual curation over automated extraction**.

We maintain a hand-verified dataset of the **150 highest-impact services** available to Kingston residents. Every entry is:

- **Verified** — No broken links or disconnected phone numbers.
- **Accessible** — Clear eligibility requirements.
- **Identity-Aware** — Evidence-backed safety tags for vulnerable populations.

## Current Features (v4.1)

### Search Intelligence

- **Synonym Expansion**: "Hungry" returns food banks; "rent" surfaces eviction prevention resources.
- **Open Now Filter**: Real-time availability based on structured operating hours.
- **Privacy-First Analytics**: Tracks unmet needs through zero-result patterns without logging queries.
- **Crisis Detection**: Automatically boosts emergency services when high-risk language is detected.

### Decentralized AI Assistant

- **Client-Side RAG**: Runs a local LLM (Phi-3) directly in the browser via WebGPU.
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Voice and text queries never leave the device.
- **Offline Vector Store**: Semantic search works without an internet connection.

### Additional Capabilities

- **Semantic and Fuzzy Search** — Natural language queries ("I feel unsafe") and typo correction ("fod" → "food").
- **Privacy by Design** — No cookies, no tracking, no search logging. All inference runs in-browser or anonymously.
- **Service Detail Pages** — Rich metadata, contact information, and localized content for each listing.
- **Partner Claiming Workflow** — Organizations can claim, verify, and maintain their own listings.
- **Progressive Web App** — Installable, works offline.
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant** — High-contrast, skip-links, and keyboard navigation.
- **Community Governance** — Residents can flag inaccurate data directly.
- **Performance Optimized** — Loads instantly, even on slow connections.
- **Bilingual Support** — Full English and French content switching.

2. Add your credentials to `.env.local`:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
   SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```
