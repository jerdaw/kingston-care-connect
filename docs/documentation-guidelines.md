# Documentation Guidelines (Internal)

Keep documentation accurate, minimal, and easy to maintain.

## Canonical sources

- **Architecture & Logic**: `docs/architecture.md`
- **UI Components**: `docs/components.md`
- **Localization**: `bilingual-dev-guide.md`
- **Governance**: `docs/governance.md`
- **Hooks & Utilities**: `docs/hooks.md`
- **Roadmap Backlog**: `docs/roadmaps/future-roadmap.md` (Planned work)
- **Historical Records**: `docs/roadmaps/archive/` (Completed work)

## When adding or changing docs

- **Prefer one canonical source**. Use pointers elsewhere instead of copying text.
- **Keep docs close to the code** they describe.
- **Update the index**: Update `README.md` or `AGENTS.md` if you add major new docs.
- **English-Only**: Internal documentation should be English-only.
- **No Phase Labels**: Avoid "phase" labels in permanent docs. Documentation should describe **what exists and how to use it**, not the order it was implemented.
- **Public-Safe**: No secrets, private emails, or internal IPs in public repos.

## Roadmap workflow

This project separates **backlog** vs **implementation plans** vs **canonical docs** to reduce drift.

- `docs/roadmaps/future-roadmap.md` is the single backlog of not-yet-implemented items.
- When you start work, create a focused implementation plan under `docs/roadmaps/` (e.g. `implementation-plan-feature-x.md`).
- When the work is done:
  1. Update canonical docs (`docs/architecture.md`, etc.) so the result is maintainable.
  2. Move the implementation plan into `docs/roadmaps/archive/` with a descriptive name.

## Naming and organization

- **Descriptive Filenames**: Use `runbook`, `checklist`, `guidelines`. Avoid vague names.
- **Roadmaps**: Put active plans in `docs/roadmaps/`.
- **Archive**: Put completed plans in `docs/roadmaps/archive/`.
- **Deployment**: `DEPLOY.md` (Root) or `docs/deployment/` (Future).
- **Development**: `AGENTS.md` (Root), `bilingual-dev-guide.md` (Root), or `docs/development/` (Future).
